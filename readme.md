# Movie Map

## Description

A one-stop web-App wherein a user can search for the name of any given movie and/or TV show and the site will return a list of every streaming service that currently has that item available for streaming, and, if necessary, will sort the results based on whether the item is free to stream, free with your subscription, free with ads, charge to rent, or a charge to buy. Users will be able to create an account to save their results, as well as create a list of their favorite movies, which the app would then use to populate a suggested list of movies in similar categories.

- In today's digital era, it is no longer a simple task to "Google" something and get a straight answer. So Googling "Where can I stream X movie?" results in a convoluted list of articles you have to read or skim to get a single streaming service as the answer.
- We built this project to alleviate the frustration of finding that special something to watch in today's digital age. 
- Gone will be the days where clickbait articles and misleading titles give you false or misleading search results. This app will tell you straight forward search results, where you can watch your favorite movies and TV shows with ease and without having to sift through convoluted search results.
- We learned many things, including how to develop web apps in the back end. Using mySQL, Sequelize, ORM, Handlebars, and working with various APIs (as well as building our own API) to communicate with various online libraries.

## Installation

-This is a simple web app. No installation is necessary. Simply visit the URL (provided here (update later)), create an account if you like (or continue anonymously if preferred), and start searching for your favorite movies and/or TV shows. It's really that simple. The web app will tell you exactly where that movie or tv show is available for streaming.

## Usage

Upon searching for a show, the web site will populate a list of streaming services that offer that result. As well as the avg user rating for that movie, and a brief summary of the plot to ensure you got the right movie.
